1.  what is MEAN stack?

    - MEAN Stack is defined as a collection of javascript technologies that can assist building complex websites or web apps

    - mongoDB: mongodb is store data for backend Application. it is document origned form like as json file

    - ExpressJS: expressjs backend application runs top of nodejs.

    - Angular: angular is frontend framework runs code in browser.

    - nodejs: nodejs which provide runtime system for javascript backend web application.

2.  what is MERN stack?

    - MERN stack it also has compirsed of four frameworks namely mongoDB, ExpressJS, React Framework and Nodejs.

    - for developing web application

    - it makes use of librabry, database and frameworks. MERN stack ensures a very smooth development process.

    - MERN stack is becoming very popular in the development market

    - MONGODB: it is document origiended NOSQL database. it is store backend data.

    - ExpressJS: which is layout framework runs top of nodejs. take care backend functionality and structured.

    - ReactJS: it is frontend librabry. create user interface components for web application.

    - NodeJS: which is run time envroment. capable of javascript in a machine

3.  what is technology stack?

    - the technology stack is combination of programing languages, framework and tools that developers use build a web or mobile app

4.  MEAN vs MERN

    - it's technology stack comprises of mongoDB, expressjs, angular and nodejs
    - it's technology stack comprises of mongoDB, expressjs, React and nodejs

    - it is javascript framework.
    - it is open source javascript library

    - MEAN used typescript language
    - MERN used javascript and jsx(combination of js and HTML)

    - The flow of data is bi-directional(any changes made in view part of application it's reflected model part is there and viceversa)
    - the flow of data is unidirectional(first models status updated then all changes rendered in view part of application)

    - has better learning curve
    - offers excellent documentation

5.  What is mongoDB?

    - mongoDB is document-oriented, no sequel (NoSQL) database.

    - Document based: represents hierarchical relationship using a single record.

    - Schema free: Lesser data migrations

6.  why MongoDB?

    - flexibility
    - flexible Query Model
    - Native aggregation
    - schema less model

7.  characteristics of MongoDB

    - general purpose database
    - flexible schema design
    - scalability and load balacing
    - aggregation framework
    - native replication
    - security features
    - json
    - MapReduce

8.  working of MongoDB?

    - datastore in documents its helps key value pairs
    - datastore in BSON format. as backend mongoDB convert JSON data to BSON(binary) data.
    - mongodb its also support nested document
    - a collection is group of documents
    - these collections are stored in the mongoDB database format

9.  Application of MongoDB

    - IOT
    - mobile application
    - real time analysis
    - personalization
    - catalog managment
    - content managment

10. What is Express JS?

    - expressjs is a nodejs framework designed for building API, web Applications and cross platform mobile app

    - Express is high performance, fast, unopinionated and lightweight

    - it is used as server side scripting language

11. need of ExpressJS

    - time Efficient
    - fast
    - money efficient
    - Easy to Learn
    - Asyschronous

12. Feature of ExpressJS

    - fast server-side Development:

      - with the help of nodejs feature, express can save lot of time

    - middleware

      - it is request handler, which have the access to the application's request-response cycle

    - Routing

      - refers to how an application's endpoints respond to client requests

    - templating:

      - create a HTML template file with less code and render HTML Pages

    - Debugging:
      - Express makes it easier as it identification the exact part where bug are

13. Advantages and disadavantages of ExpressJS

    Advantages:

    - Express is very easy we can customize and use it per out needs

    - A single language javascript is used for frontend and backend development

    - it is very fast to link with database like mySQL, mongoDB etc

    DisAdvantages:

    - No structure way to organizing things

    - there are so many issue in callback

    - the error message are not very helpful

14. What is React?

    - react is js library for building fast and interactive user interface for the web as well as mobile applications.

    - it is an open-source, reusable component-based front-end library

    - in model, View Controller architecture, React is "view" which is reponsible for how the app looks and feels.

    - exmaple instagram

      - search components
      - profile description components
      - stories components
      - post list components
      - single post components

    - react divides the UI into multiple components, which makes the code easier to debug, and each components has its own property and function.

15. why React used?

    - Easy creation of dynamic web applictions
    - performace ehancements
    - resuable components
    - unidirectional data flow
    - small learning curve
    - can be used for mobile apps
    - Dedicated tools for easy debugging

16. feature of React

    - JSX(combination of HTML and JS)
    - virtual DOM(document object model)
    - performace
    - one way data binding(unidirectional data flow)
    - extension (SSR, Flux)
    - debugging

17. Explain Flux.

    - Flux implements unidirectional flow which makes it easier to deduce what's going on

    - Dispatcher: when we trigger an action the dispatcher will get notified.

    - store: once the dispatcher has dealt with an action the store listening to it get triggered

    - View: The view gets updated when the state of the store changes

    - Action: user action at view is send to dispatcher to be processed

18. What is components

    - components are the building block of any react application and single app usually consists of multiple components

19. what is Props?

    - Props is short for properties that allow us to pass arguments or data to components.

20. what is state?

    - state of a components is object that holds some data

21. what is nodejs?

    - nodejs is open source, cross platform javascript runtime enviroment and library for running web application outside the client's browser

    - it is used for creating server-side web applications

    - nodejs is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses asynchronous, event-driven model.

    - nodejs was developed by ryan dahi in 2009 and its latest version is v13.3.0

22. why nodejs?

    - nodejs is really fast

    - node package, Manager has over 50,000 bundies for at the developer's disposal

    - perfect for data intensive, real-time web application as nodejs wait for api to return data

    - Batter synchronizion of code between server and client due to same code base.

    - easy for web developer to start using nodejs in their projects as it is js library

23. part of nodejs?

    - modules
