1.  **What is ExpressJS**

    - Express.js is a fast, minimal web framework for Node.js, used to build web applications and APIs. It simplifies handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware, making it ideal for creating scalable and efficient server-side applications.

2.  **Feature of ExpressJS**

    - Minimal and Flexible

    - Middleware Support: Middleware can be used for tasks like parsing incoming request data, authentication, logging, and error handling.

    - Routing:manage different endpoints and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) easily.

    - Template Engine: used to generate HTML pages dynamically.

    - Asynchronous: Express.js supports non-blocking, asynchronous code, allowing efficient handling of multiple requests simultaneously.

    - REST API Development: Express.js is commonly used to build RESTful APIs due to its simplicity in handling routes and HTTP methods.

    - Integration with Databases: Express.js can easily be integrated with databases like MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL, making it a great choice for building full-stack applications.

3.  **Why use ExpressJS**

    - Simplicity: Easy to set up and use for building web applications and APIs.
    - Flexibility: Minimalistic structure, allowing developers to customize as needed.
    - Routing: Simplifies defining routes for different endpoints and HTTP methods.
    - Middleware Support: Provides powerful middleware to handle requests, responses, logging, authentication, etc.
    - Asynchronous: Leverages Node.js's non-blocking, asynchronous architecture for high performance.
    - Templating: Supports dynamic page rendering with templating engines like Pug and EJS.
    - RESTful APIs: Perfect for building RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently.
    - Community Support: Large ecosystem with many plugins and tools available.

4.  **Write a ‘Hello World’ Express.js application?**

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();
    const PORT = 8000;

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.send("Hello World!");
    });

    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server is listening at port :${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

5.  **Why Separate the Express App and Server?**

    - Code Organization: Separating logic makes the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
    - Testability: Allows you to test the Express app independently from the server, improving test coverage and making unit testing simpler.
    - Reusability: The app can be reused in different environments, such as serverless platforms, without changes to server setup.
    - Scalability: Separation makes scaling easier by decoupling app logic from server configuration, supporting different server instances.
    - Flexibility: Facilitates switching server configurations or environments without changing core app logic.

6.  **What is middleware?**

    - Middleware is the function that works between the request and the response cycle. Middleware gets executed after the server receives the request and before the controller sends the response.

7.  **Built-in Middlewares in Express.js**

    1.  `express.static`:

        - Serves static files like HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript.
        - Example: `app.use(express.static('public'))` to serve files from the public directory.

    2.  `express.json`:

        - Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.
        - Example: `app.use(express.json())` to handle JSON body parsing in POST/PUT requests.

    3.  `express.urlencoded`:

        - Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (from HTML form submissions).
        - Example: `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))` to handle form data

    4.  `express.text`:

        - Parses incoming requests with plain text payloads.
        - Example: `app.use(express.text())` to handle plain text data in the request body.

    5.  `express.raw`:

        - Parses incoming requests with raw binary data (Buffer objects).
        - Example: `app.use(express.raw())` to handle binary file uploads or raw data.

8.  **Explain body Parser middleware in express js**

    - The body-parser middleware in Express.js is used to parse the incoming request bodies and make the data accessible via req.body.

    **_Key Features_**

    - JSON Parsing:

      - parse incoming request with json payload.
      - Example: `app.use(express.json())` parses requests with `Content-Type: application/json`.

    - URL-encoded Data Parsing:

      - Parses data sent via HTML forms or URL-encoded data.
      - Example: `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))` handles form data like `name=value` pairs.
      - extended: true allows parsing nested objects.

    - Text Parsing:

      - Parses incoming requests with plain text payloads.
      - Example: `app.use(express.text())` parses requests with `Content-Type: text/plain`.

    - Raw Data Parsing:

      - Parses incoming requests with raw binary data (Buffer objects).
      - Example: `app.use(express.raw())` parses requests with raw data, often used in file uploads or other binary data transfers.

    **_Why Use It_**

    - Simplifies Request Handling: Automatically parses incoming request data, reducing the need for manual parsing.
    - Supports Multiple Formats: Handles JSON, form data, text, and binary data, making it flexible for various types of applications.
    - Access Data in req.body: Makes it easy to access parsed data in the request handler through req.body.

    Note: In modern Express.js versions (4.16+), the functionality of body-parser is included directly within Express itself, so you don't need to install body-parser separately.

9.  **Explain the types of middlewares?**

    **Application Middleware:**

    - Definition: Middleware that is bound to an instance of the Express application

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();

    // Application Middleware: Logging middleware
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      console.log(`Request Method: ${req.method}, Request URL: ${req.url}`);
      next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route handler
    });

    // Another example of Application Middleware: JSON body parser
    app.use(express.json()); // Parses JSON request bodies

    // Sample route
    app.post("/data", (req, res) => {
      res.send(`Received data: ${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`);
    });

    // Start the server
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

    **Router Middleware**

    - Router middleware is specific to routes defined by an Express.Router instance.

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();
    const router = express.Router();

    // Middleware specific to this router
    router.use((req, res, next) => {
      console.log(`User Router: ${req.method} request for '${req.url}'`);
      next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route handler
    });

    // Sample route for getting user details
    router.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
      const userId = req.params.id;
      res.send(`Fetching details for user with ID: ${userId}`);
    });

    // Sample route for creating a new user
    router.post("/users", (req, res) => {
      // Assuming the body contains user data in JSON format
      res.send(`Creating new user with data: ${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`);
    });

    // Applying the router middleware to the '/api' path
    app.use("/api", router);

    // Start the server
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

    - Router Middleware: The router.use() function adds middleware specific to this router, logging the request method and URL for any request made to routes under this router.

    - Applying the Router: The router is applied to the /api path using app.use('/api', router), which means all routes defined in this router will be prefixed with /api.

    **Error-handling Middleware**

    - Definition: Middleware specifically designed to handle errors that occur during request processing.

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();

    // Middleware to simulate an error
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      // Simulating a server error
      if (req.url === "/error") {
        const err = new Error("Something went wrong!");
        err.status = 500; // Set a custom error status
        return next(err); // Pass the error to the error-handling middleware
      }
      next(); // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
    });

    // Sample route
    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.send("Welcome to the home page!");
    });

    // Error-handling Middleware
    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
      console.error(err.message); // Log the error message
      res.status(err.status || 500).send({
        error: {
          message: err.message, // Send the error message in the response
          status: err.status || 500, // Send the error status
        },
      });
    });

    // Start the server
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

    - Simulating an Error: The middleware checks if the request URL is /error. If it is, it creates a new Error object and passes it to the next middleware using next(err).

    - Error-handling Middleware: This middleware logs the error message to the console and sends a JSON response with the error message and status code. It catches any error passed to it by previous middleware or routes.

    - Custom Error Status: You can set a custom error status on the error object (e.g., err.status = 500) to control the HTTP status code returned in the response.

    **Third-party Middleware**

    - Definition: Middleware that is created by the community and can be installed via npm to add additional functionalities.

    - Install Morgan: First, you'll need to install the morgan package via npm.

    ```javascript
    npm install morgan
    ```

    - Create an Express App Using Morgan:

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const morgan = require("morgan");

    const app = express();

    //'combined': Standard Apache logging format.
    //'common': Common log format.
    //'dev': Colored concise output.
    //'tiny': Minimal output.

    // Using morgan middleware for logging HTTP requests
    app.use(morgan("combined")); // You can use different formats like 'tiny', 'dev', etc.

    // Sample route
    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.send("Welcome to the home page!");
    });

    // Another sample route
    app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
      res.send("This is the about page.");
    });

    // Start the server
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

    **Built-in Middleware**

    - Definition: Middleware that is included with Express to handle common tasks like parsing request bodies and serving static files.

    - JSON Body Parser

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();

    // Built-in Middleware: JSON body parser
    app.use(express.json()); // Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads

    // Sample route to handle POST requests
    app.post("/data", (req, res) => {
      res.send(`Received data: ${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`);
    });

    // Start the server
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

    - Serving Static Files

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();

    // Built-in Middleware: Serve static files from 'public' directory
    app.use(express.static("public")); // Serves files from the 'public' directory

    // Start the server
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

    **custom middleware**

    - Definition: User-defined middleware functions that can perform specific tasks or operations.

    - Custom Logging Middleware

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();

    // Custom Middleware: Logging middleware
    const requestLogger = (req, res, next) => {
      const currentTime = new Date();
      console.log(
        `[${currentTime.toISOString()}] ${req.method} request to ${req.url}`
      );
      next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route handler
    };

    // Use the custom middleware for all routes
    app.use(requestLogger);

    // Sample route for the home page
    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.send("Welcome to the home page!");
    });

    // Sample route for the about page
    app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
      res.send("This is the about page.");
    });

    // Start the server
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

    - Custom Middleware with Conditional Logic

    ```javascript
    // Custom Middleware: Header Check
    const checkCustomHeader = (req, res, next) => {
      if (req.headers["x-custom-header"]) {
        console.log("Custom header is present");
        next(); // Proceed if the custom header is present
      } else {
        res.status(400).send("Bad Request: Missing Custom Header");
      }
    };

    // Use the header check middleware for a specific route
    app.get("/api/data", checkCustomHeader, (req, res) => {
      res.send("Data retrieved successfully!");
    });
    ```

10. **Mention some third-party middleware provided by Express JS.**

    - Helmet: A security middleware that helps set various HTTP headers to protect your Express application from common vulnerabilities.

    - CORS: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing your application to specify which domains can access its resources.

    - Morgan: A logging middleware that provides HTTP request logging in the console or a file, useful for monitoring and debugging.

    - Body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.

    - Express-rate-limit: Middleware that limits repeated requests to public APIs and endpoints to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.

    - Cookie-parser: A middleware to parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names.

    - Session: Middleware for managing user sessions, allowing you to store user-specific data across multiple requests.

    - Passport: Middleware for authentication, providing a simple way to implement various authentication strategies (like OAuth, Local, etc.).

11. **How to implement Helmet**

    - A security middleware that helps set various HTTP headers to protect your Express application from common vulnerabilities.

    ```javascript
    npm install helmet
    ```

    - Here’s how to set up an Express application with Helmet:

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const helmet = require("helmet");

    const app = express();

    // Use Helmet middleware
    app.use(helmet());

    // Example route
    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.send("Welcome to the Express app with Helmet!");
    });

    // Start the server
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

    - Customizing Helmet

    - Disable Specific Helmet Features: If you want to disable a particular security header, you can do so like this:

    ```javascript
    app.use(
      helmet({
        contentSecurityPolicy: false, // Disable Content Security Policy
      })
    );
    ```

    - Setting Custom Content Security Policy: If you want to set a specific Content Security Policy, you can do it like this:

    ```javascript
    helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
      directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://apis.google.com"],
      },
    });
    ```

    - Example with Customizations:

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const helmet = require("helmet");

    const app = express();

    // Use Helmet with custom configuration
    app.use(
      helmet({
        contentSecurityPolicy: {
          directives: {
            defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
            scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://apis.google.com"],
          },
        },
        frameguard: { action: "deny" }, // Prevents clickjacking
      })
    );

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.send("Welcome to the Express app with customized Helmet!");
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

    - Using Helmet in your Express.js application helps to enhance security by setting various HTTP headers. You can apply it with default settings or customize it according to your application's requirements to ensure a secure environment.

12. **how to implement CROS in ExpressJS**

    - Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing your application to specify which domains can access its resources.

    - Using the cors middleware in your Express.js application is a straightforward way to enable CORS, allowing you to control which origins can access your resources. You can customize the CORS configuration according to your application's needs.

    - Basic Usage: To allow all origins

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const cors = require("cors");

    const app = express();

    // Enable CORS for all routes
    app.use(cors());

    app.get("/api/data", (req, res) => {
      res.json({ message: "This is a CORS-enabled response!" });
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

    - Allow Specific Origins: To allow only specific origins

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const cors = require("cors");

    const app = express();

    // Enable CORS for specific origin
    const corsOptions = {
      origin: "https://your-allowed-origin.com",
    };

    app.use(cors(corsOptions));

    app.get("/api/data", (req, res) => {
      res.json({
        message: "This is a CORS-enabled response for a specific origin!",
      });
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

    - Customizing CORS Options

    - You can customize CORS further by adding options for methods, allowed headers, and credentials

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const cors = require("cors");

    const app = express();

    const corsOptions = {
      origin: "https://your-allowed-origin.com",
      methods: "GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE", // allowed methods
      allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"], // allowed headers
      credentials: true, // allow credentials (cookies, authorization headers)
    };

    app.use(cors(corsOptions));

    app.get("/api/data", (req, res) => {
      res.json({ message: "This response includes custom CORS options!" });
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

13. **how to implment session in ExpressJS?**

    - Middleware for managing user sessions, allowing you to store user-specific data across multiple requests.

    ```javascript
    npm install express-session
    ```

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const session = require("express-session");

    const app = express();

    // Set up session middleware
    app.use(
      session({
        secret: "your-secret-key", // used to sign the session ID cookie
        resave: false, // forces session to be saved back to the store
        saveUninitialized: true, // saves a new session even if it hasn't been modified
        cookie: { secure: false }, // set to true if using HTTPS
      })
    );

    // Route to set a session value
    app.get("/login", (req, res) => {
      req.session.user = { username: "JohnDoe" }; // Storing user info in session
      res.send("User logged in!");
    });

    // Route to get session value
    app.get("/dashboard", (req, res) => {
      if (req.session.user) {
        res.send(`Welcome, ${req.session.user.username}!`);
      } else {
        res.send("Please log in first.");
      }
    });

    // Route to log out
    app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
      req.session.destroy((err) => {
        if (err) {
          return res.send("Error logging out.");
        }
        res.send("User logged out.");
      });
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

    - Sessions in Express.js provide a way to maintain user-specific information across multiple requests, enhancing the ability to create dynamic and interactive web applications. By using the express-session middleware, developers can easily implement session management, ensuring a better user experience.

14. **how to implement body-parser in Expressjs**

    - Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.

    ```javascript
    npm install body-parser
    ```

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

    const app = express();

    // Middleware to parse application/json
    app.use(bodyParser.json());

    // Middleware to parse application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

    // Example route to handle POST requests
    app.post("/submit", (req, res) => {
      // Access parsed data in req.body
      console.log(req.body);
      res.send("Data received!");
    });

    // Start the server
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

    - If you are using Express 4.16.0 or later, you can use the built-in middleware directly without the need for the body-parser package:

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");

    const app = express();

    // Built-in middleware to parse application/json
    app.use(express.json());

    // Built-in middleware to parse application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

    // Example route to handle POST requests
    app.post("/submit", (req, res) => {
      console.log(req.body); // Access parsed data in req.body
      res.send("Data received!");
    });

    // Start the server
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

    - You can implement body parsing in Express.js either by using the body-parser package or the built-in middleware for JSON and URL-encoded form data. This allows you to easily handle incoming request payloads and access the data in your route handlers.

15. **how to implement of Cookie-parser in expressjs**

    - A middleware to parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names.

    ```javascript
    npm install cookie-parser
    ```

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");

    const app = express();

    // Use cookie-parser middleware
    app.use(cookieParser());

    // Example route to set a cookie
    app.get("/setcookie", (req, res) => {
      res.cookie("username", "JohnDoe", { maxAge: 900000, httpOnly: true });
      res.send("Cookie has been set!");
    });

    // Example route to read a cookie
    app.get("/getcookie", (req, res) => {
      const username = req.cookies.username; // Access the cookie
      if (username) {
        res.send(`Welcome back, ${username}!`);
      } else {
        res.send("No cookie found.");
      }
    });

    // Example route to clear a cookie
    app.get("/clearcookie", (req, res) => {
      res.clearCookie("username");
      res.send("Cookie has been cleared!");
    });

    // Start the server
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

    - Using cookie-parser in your Express.js application allows you to easily manage cookies. You can set, read, and clear cookies with minimal effort, enhancing the functionality of your web application.

16. **how to implement Passport in expressjs**

    - Middleware for authentication, providing a simple way to implement various authentication strategies (like OAuth, Local, etc.).

    ```javascript
    npm install express passport passport-local express-session
    ```

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const passport = require("passport");
    const LocalStrategy = require("passport-local").Strategy;
    const session = require("express-session");

    const app = express();

    // In-memory user store (for demo purposes only)
    const users = [];

    // Middleware for parsing request bodies
    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

    // Session middleware
    app.use(
      session({
        secret: "your-secret-key",
        resave: false,
        saveUninitialized: true,
      })
    );

    // Initialize Passport
    app.use(passport.initialize());
    app.use(passport.session());

    // Configure the local strategy for Passport
    passport.use(
      new LocalStrategy((username, password, done) => {
        // Find user in the "database"
        const user = users.find((user) => user.username === username);
        if (!user) {
          return done(null, false, { message: "Incorrect username." });
        }
        if (user.password !== password) {
          return done(null, false, { message: "Incorrect password." });
        }
        return done(null, user);
      })
    );

    // Serialize user into the session
    passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
      done(null, user.username);
    });

    // Deserialize user from the session
    passport.deserializeUser((username, done) => {
      const user = users.find((user) => user.username === username);
      done(null, user);
    });

    // Route to register a new user
    app.post("/register", (req, res) => {
      const { username, password } = req.body;
      users.push({ username, password });
      res.send("User registered!");
    });

    // Route for login
    app.post(
      "/login",
      passport.authenticate("local", {
        successRedirect: "/dashboard",
        failureRedirect: "/login-failure",
      })
    );

    // Route to display the dashboard (protected)
    app.get("/dashboard", (req, res) => {
      if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        res.send(`Welcome to your dashboard, ${req.user.username}!`);
      } else {
        res.redirect("/login-failure");
      }
    });

    // Route for login failure
    app.get("/login-failure", (req, res) => {
      res.send("Login failed. Please try again.");
    });

    // Route for logging out
    app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
      req.logout();
      res.send("You have logged out.");
    });

    // Start the server
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

    **_Explanation of the Code_**

    - Import Required Modules: Import express, passport, passport-local, and express-session.

    - Create an Express App: Initialize the Express application.

    - User Storage: In this example, users are stored in an in-memory array. In a real application, you would typically store users in a database.

    - Middleware Setup

      - Use express.urlencoded() to parse incoming request bodies.
      - Use express-session() to manage user sessions.
      - Initialize Passport with passport.initialize() and passport.session().

    - Configure Passport Local Strategy

      - Use passport.use() to set up the local strategy for authentication. The callback function checks if the user exists and validates the password.

    - Serialize and Deserialize User:

      - passport.serializeUser() and passport.deserializeUser() manage user session storage.

    - Define Route

      - /register: Registers a new user by pushing the username and password to the users array.
      - /login: Authenticates the user using Passport's passport.authenticate() method.
      - /dashboard: Displays the user's dashboard if authenticated; otherwise, redirects to the login failure route.
      - /login-failure: Displays a message if login fails.
      - /logout: Logs out the user.

    - summary: This setup demonstrates a basic implementation of Passport for local authentication in an Express.js application. You can extend this example by adding password hashing, input validation, and integrating a database for storing users. Additionally, Passport supports multiple authentication strategies, which you can implement similarly.

17. **how to implement Express-rate-limit in expressjs**

    - Middleware that limits repeated requests to public APIs and endpoints to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.

    ```javascript
    npm install express-rate-limit
    ```

    - how to set up an Express application with express-rate-limit:

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

    const app = express();

    // Create a rate limiter
    const limiter = rateLimit({
      windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
      max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
      message: "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.",
    });

    // Apply the rate limiter to all requests
    app.use(limiter);

    // Example route
    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.send("Welcome to the Express app with rate limiting!");
    });

    // Another example route
    app.get("/api", (req, res) => {
      res.send("This is a rate-limited API endpoint.");
    });

    // Start the server
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

    - If you want to apply the rate limit to specific routes only, you can do so by adding the limiter as middleware to those routes:

    ```javascript
    app.post("/login", limiter, (req, res) => {
      // Login logic here
      res.send("Login route with rate limiting!");
    });

    app.get("/api", limiter, (req, res) => {
      res.send("This is a rate-limited API endpoint.");
    });
    ```

    - Using express-rate-limit in your Express.js application helps you manage the rate of requests and prevent abuse of your API or web application. You can customize the settings based on your application's needs to ensure optimal performance and security.

18. **What is Restful API and Rest API**

    - REST API: An API that follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication.

    - RESTful API: A REST API that adheres strictly to REST principles, ensuring statelessness, resource-based URLs, and proper usage of HTTP methods.

    - RESTful APIs are widely used because they provide a clear structure for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, making them an ideal choice for modern web services.

19. **Why Use RESTful APIs?**

    - Scalability: RESTful APIs are stateless, allowing for easier horizontal scaling.
    - Flexibility: They can handle multiple types of clients (web, mobile, etc.) due to their use of standard HTTP methods and formats like JSON or XML.
    - Simplicity: The use of URLs for resources and HTTP methods simplifies interaction between client and server.
    - Separation of Concerns: RESTful APIs decouple the front-end and back-end, allowing for independent development and maintenance.
    - Interoperability: RESTful APIs follow standard web protocols, making it easier for different systems to communicate with each other.
    - Performance: Statelessness and cacheable responses improve the performance and reduce server load.

20. **how the web work?**

    - The web works by enabling communication between clients (browsers) and servers using the internet. Here’s a simple explanation of how it works step-by-step

    **1. User Requests a Web Page**

    - A user types a web address (URL) into a browser (client), such as www.example.com, or clicks on a link.
    - This action sends a request to a web server, which hosts the website.

    **2. DNS Lookup**

    - The browser doesn’t directly understand domain names (like www.example.com). It first needs to convert the domain name into an IP address, which identifies the server.
    - The browser uses a Domain Name System (DNS) to find the IP address of the server associated with the domain.

    **3. Browser Sends HTTP Request**

    - Once the browser knows the IP address of the server, it sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server.
    - The request typically includes:
      - Method (e.g., GET, POST)
      - URL (the resource requested)
      - Headers (browser information, cookies, etc.)
      - Data (if it's a POST request)

    **4. Server Processes the Request**

    - The server receives the HTTP request and processes it. The server might
    - Retrieve an HTML page, image, or other files from its storage.
    - Run backend code (e.g., in Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.) to generate a dynamic response.

    **5. Server Sends a Response**

    - The server sends back an HTTP response to the browser. The response includes:

      - Status code (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server error)
      - Headers (additional information like content type, caching details, etc.)
      - Body (the actual content, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, images, etc.)

    **6. Browser Renders the Page**

    - The browser receives the response and begins to process it

      - If it's an HTML file, the browser starts rendering the page.
      - If the page includes additional resources like CSS, JavaScript, or images, the browser sends separate requests to the server to retrieve them.

    - The browser then executes any JavaScript and applies CSS to style the page

    **7. User Interacts with the Page**

    - Once the page is loaded, the user can interact with it (e.g., clicking buttons, filling out forms).
    - These actions might trigger new requests to the server (e.g., submitting a form), or they might execute code within the browser (e.g., a JavaScript function).

    **8. Data Transfer (Optional)**

    - If the user interacts with elements like forms or buttons, AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) or fetch calls can send data to the server without reloading the entire page.
    - The server processes the data and sends back a response (often in JSON format), which updates the web page dynamically.

21. **Key Components of Web Working**

    **1. Client (Browser)**

    - Displays the web page and interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Sends requests and receives responses from the server.

    **2. Server**

    - Stores the web application or website content.
    - Processes incoming requests and sends back appropriate responses (HTML, JSON, images, etc.).

    **3. HTTP/HTTPS:**

    - The protocol that defines how requests and responses are transmitted over the web.
    - HTTPS (Secure) uses encryption to ensure data is securely transferred between the client and server.

    **4. DNS**

    - A service that converts human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses, allowing the browser to locate the correct server.

    Example:

    - User: Types www.example.com into the browser.
    - Browser: Sends an HTTP GET request to the server at the IP address returned by the DNS lookup.
    - Server: Responds with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
    - Browser: Displays the webpage, applies CSS for styling, and runs JavaScript for interactivity.
    - User: Clicks on a link, triggering a new request to the server.

    - This is how the web works! Each request and response involves a lot of behind-the-scenes activities like DNS resolution, routing, data transmission, and more, but this process allows users to interact with websites easily.

22. **full form of CORS and ACAO**

    - CORS: cross origin resource sharing
    - ACAO: Access cross Allow Origin

23. **Under what circumstances does a Cross-Origin resource fail in Express JS?**

    - When a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing request is made, the browser enforces certain security checks, and the request may fail under various circumstances:

    - No CORS Headers: The server response lacks required CORS headers.
    - Mismatched Origin: The request origin doesn’t match the allowed origin in the CORS header.
    - Restricted HTTP Methods: The browser restricts certain HTTP methods in cross-origin requests.
    - No Credentials: Cross-origin requests with credentials (cookies/auth) face browser restrictions.

24. **How would you render plain HTML using Express JS?**

    ```javascript
    //using res.send
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();
    const port = 8000;

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      const htmlContent = "<html><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>";
      res.send(htmlContent);
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
    });
    ```

25. **Name some databases that integrate with Express JS?**

    - mySQL
    - MongoDB
    - PostgreSQL
    - SQLite
    - Oracle

26. **Advantages of REST API**

    - REST API is a lightweight and flexible architecture that can be easily implemented on any platform or language.
    - REST API is stateless, which means that each request contains all the necessary information to complete the request. This allows for scalability and reduces the load on the server.
    - REST API is widely adopted and supported by most modern programming languages and frameworks.
    - REST API provides a simple and standardized way of accessing resources over the internet.

27. **DisAdvantages of REST API**

    - REST API may not be the best choice for complex business logic and workflows.
    - REST API can be difficult to implement in certain situations, especially when dealing with complex data structures.
    - REST API does not provide a built-in authentication or authorization mechanism, which means that developers must implement their own security measures.

28. **Advantages of RESTful API**

    - RESTful API is a standardized implementation of the REST architecture, which makes it easier for developers to build and maintain web services.
    - RESTful API provides a uniform interface for accessing resources, which simplifies the development process.
    - RESTful API supports caching, which can improve performance by reducing the number of requests sent to the server.
    - RESTful API can be used of data formats, including JSON.

29. **DisAdvantages of RESTful API**

    - RESTful API may not be suitable for complex business logic and workflows.
    - RESTful API can be slower than other web service architectures, when dealing with large amounts of data.

30. **Similarities between REST API and RESTful API**

    - Both REST API and RESTful API are based on the REST architecture
    - Both REST API and RESTful API are stateless, which means that each request contains all the necessary information to complete the request.
    - Both REST API and RESTful API provide a simple and standardized way of accessing resources over the internet.

31. **Different BetWeen of REST and RESTful API**

    - REST is a set of constraints,
    - RESTful is an API adhering to those constraints.

    - Develops APIs to enable client-server interaction.
    - Web application follows REST architecture, providing interoperability between different systems.

    - Highly adaptable and user-friendly
    - Too flexible

    - Strong protocol and is more secure, built-in architecture layers.
    - Has a transport protocol, is less secure as compared to REST.

    - Format of data is based on HTTP.
    - Format of data is based on HTTP, text, and JSON.

    - This consumes minimum bandwidth.
    - This consumes less bandwidth.

32. **How would you configure properties in Express JS?**

    - In Express JS, you can configure properties using the app.set() method. This method allows you to set various properties and options which affects the behavior of the Express application.

    ```javascript
    app.set(name, value);
    ```

33. **Differentiate between res.send() and res.json()**

    - res.send() can send various types of responses (strings, objects, buffers), while res.json() specifically sends a JSON response and sets the Content-Type to application/json.

34. What is Bcrypt used for?

    - Bcrypt is used for securely hashing passwords to protect them from being easily deciphered in case of data breaches.

35. **What are JWT?**

    - Json Web Tokens are mainly a token which is used for authentication and information exchange. When a user signs in to an application, the application then assigns JWT to that user. Subsequent requests by the user will include the assigned JWT. This token tells the server what routes, services, and resources the user is allowed to access. Json Web Token includes 3 part namely- Header, Payload and Signature.

36. **Create a simple middleware for validating user.**

    ```javascript
    // Simple user validation middleware
    const validateUser = (req, res, next) => {
      const user = req.user;

      // Check if the user object is present
      if (!user) {
        return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized - User not found" });
      }

      // If the user is valid, move to the next middleware or route handler
      next();
    };

    // Example of using the middleware in an Express route
    app.get("/profile", validateUser, (req, res) => {
      const user = req.user;
      res.json({ message: "Profile page", username: user.username });
    });
    ```

37. **how to implement jwt in express js**

    ```javascript
    npm install jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
    ```

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
    const bcrypt = require("bcryptjs"); // Optional for password hashing

    const app = express();
    app.use(express.json());

    // Secret key for signing JWT
    const SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key"; // Should be stored securely (e.g., env variables)

    // Mock user data (in real apps, this comes from a database)
    const users = [
      {
        id: 1,
        username: "john",
        password:
          "$2a$10$7A9FnJlN3EomGGGlPeBDceXmoWUKgxEsViRl2VOoNZBbqg2D8.Q7K", // bcrypt hash of 'password123'
      },
    ];

    // Login route (user authentication and JWT generation)
    app.post("/login", async (req, res) => {
      const { username, password } = req.body;

      // Find the user by username
      const user = users.find((u) => u.username === username);
      if (!user) {
        return res.status(400).json({ message: "User not found" });
      }

      // Validate password
      const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
      if (!isPasswordValid) {
        return res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid password" });
      }

      // Generate JWT
      const token = jwt.sign(
        { id: user.id, username: user.username },
        SECRET_KEY,
        {
          expiresIn: "1h", // Token expiry time
        }
      );

      res.json({ message: "Login successful", token });
    });

    // Middleware to protect routes (JWT verification)
    const authenticateJWT = (req, res, next) => {
      const token = req.header("Authorization")?.split(" ")[1];

      if (!token) {
        return res.status(403).json({ message: "Access denied" });
      }

      try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY);
        req.user = decoded; // Attach decoded token data to the request
        next(); // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid token" });
      }
    };

    // Protected route (requires valid JWT)
    app.get("/protected", authenticateJWT, (req, res) => {
      res.json({
        message: `Hello, ${req.user.username}, you have access to this protected route.`,
      });
    });

    // Start the server
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
    });
    ```

    - JWT Generation (/login): When a user logs in successfully, a JWT is created using jwt.sign(), with the user information (payload) and a secret key. The token is sent back in the response.

    - JWT Verification (Middleware): For protected routes, authenticateJWT middleware checks if the request includes a valid JWT in the Authorization header. If valid, it allows access; otherwise, it denies access.

38. **What is .env file used for?**

    - The .env file is used for storing sensitive information in a web application. such as API keys, database credentials, and secret keys, in a secure and centralized way. that information avilable in key value pair.

39. **Which major tools can be integrated with Express JS?**

    - Database tools: MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
    - Template Engines: EJS, Pug, Mustache.
    - Authentication libraries: Passport.js.
    - Logging libraries: Morgan, Winston.
    - Validation libraries: Joi, express-validator.
    - ORM libraries: Sequelize, Mongoose.

40. **What are some popular alternatives to Express JS?**

    - Koa.js, Hapi.js, Sails.js, Fastify etc.

41. **Explain the structure of an Express JS application?**

    - example Express.js application that demonstrates the typical structure with code for each part:

    **Main Entry Point:** `app.js or server.js`

    - This is the core file where the Express application is initialized and configured. It handles middleware setup, routes, and starting the server.

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const dotenv = require("dotenv");
    const connectDB = require("./config/db");
    const userRoutes = require("./routes/users");

    dotenv.config(); // Load environment variables from .env file

    const app = express();
    app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON request bodies

    // Connect to database
    connectDB();

    // Routes
    app.use("/api/users", userRoutes);

    // Server setup
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

    **Routing Layer** `routes/users.js`

    - Contains route definitions and logic for different parts of the application. For example, user routes and product routes can be organized into separate files.

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const {
      getAllUsers,
      createUser,
    } = require("../controllers/userController");
    const router = express.Router();

    // Route to get all users
    router.get("/", getAllUsers);

    // Route to create a new user
    router.post("/", createUser);

    module.exports = router;
    ```

    **Business Logic** `controllers/userController.js`

    - Controllers handle the core logic of different requests. They process incoming requests, interact with models, and send responses.

    ```javascript
    const User = require("../models/userModel");

    // Get all users
    exports.getAllUsers = async (req, res) => {
      try {
        const users = await User.find();
        res.json(users);
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: "Server Error" });
      }
    };

    // Create a new user
    exports.createUser = async (req, res) => {
      const { name, email, password } = req.body;

      try {
        const newUser = new User({ name, email, password });
        await newUser.save();
        res.status(201).json(newUser);
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: "Server Error" });
      }
    };
    ```

    **Configuration** `config/db.js`

    - Stores configuration settings for the application, such as database connections or environment variables.

    ```javascript
    const mongoose = require("mongoose");

    const connectDB = async () => {
      try {
        await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
          useNewUrlParser: true,
          useUnifiedTopology: true,
        });
        console.log("MongoDB connected successfully");
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Database connection failed:", error);
        process.exit(1); // Exit process with failure
      }
    };

    module.exports = connectDB;
    ```

    **Data Models** `models/userModel.js`

    - This directory model definitions, often with a schema that interacts with databases (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL).

    ```javascript
    const mongoose = require("mongoose");

    const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
      {
        name: {
          type: String,
          required: true,
        },
        email: {
          type: String,
          required: true,
          unique: true,
        },
        password: {
          type: String,
          required: true,
        },
      },
      { timestamps: true }
    );

    const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
    module.exports = User;
    ```

    **Custom Middleware** `middleware/auth.js`

    - Middleware functions that perform operations on requests and responses, such as authentication, logging, or error handling.

    ```javascript
    const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

    const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
      const token = req.header("Authorization")?.split(" ")[1];

      if (!token) {
        return res.status(401).json({ message: "Access denied" });
      }

      try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        req.user = decoded;
        next();
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).json({ message: "Invalid token" });

    module.exports = authenticateToken;

    **Static Files** `public/`

    - This directory holds static assets like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. Express can serve these files using express.static().

    ```javascript
    app.use(express.static("public"));
    ```

    **Templates for Rendering** `views/index.ejs`

    - If the app uses a templating engine (like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars), this folder holds the view files used for rendering HTML.

    ```javascript
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Express App</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to My Express App</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    **Environment Variables** `.env`

    - Contains environment-specific variables (like API keys, database URIs) that should not be hard-coded in the application.

    ```javascript
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/express_app
    ```
