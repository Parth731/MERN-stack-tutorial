    **_NXZSound_**

    - The NXZSound project is a web application developed using React.js with class-based components, integrating audio and videos management libraries like React Wavesurfer and react-player. The platform is designed for seamless audio/video handling, providing users with a rich and interactive audio/video playback experience. My contributions involved optimizing audio/video components, ensuring smooth performance, and enhancing the user interface to deliver a high-quality audio experience.

    **_Rajasthan Tourism Management System (RTMS)_**

    - The Rajasthan Tourism Management System (RTMS) is a comprehensive platform divided into two key components:

    **1. Online Booking and Management System (OBMS):**

    - Built using Next.js and Java, this system serves as the backbone for managing Rajasthan's tourism operations, with roles for admin, vendor, and operators. I was responsible for developing the admin and vendor management workflows, including:

      - Department management
      - Ticket management
      - Season management
      - Vendor and operator management
      - Inventory and non-inventory management

    - Additionally, I implemented e-Mitra payment gateway integration, allowing users to scan QR codes and complete payments, which automatically generates tickets with QR codes using the React QR code library.

    **2. Content Management System (CMS):**

    - Built using Next.js and Strapi, this system provides informational content on Rajasthan tourism. I implemented the backend using Strapi with GraphQL, ensuring efficient data handling and content delivery.

    **_911 Police Management System_**

    - The 911 Police Management System is a robust application for managing police operations, built with Next.js and Java for the web, and Flutter for the mobile counterpart. This system allows the management of police department records, with separate roles for department admins and super admins:

    - Department admins can manage police officer data for their respective stations.

    - Super admins oversee the entire system, managing users and departments efficiently.

    - SOS request handling: When an SOS request is made, the system locates the nearest police station and tracks the user’s live location. Police officers can then respond and track users in real time, with icons representing police vehicles on the map using Google Maps API.

    - Video calling and messaging: Implemented using Agora, with notifications managed through PubNub.

    - History management: Maintaining records of SOS requests, video calls, and chat history for both police officers and super admins.

    **_Time Management System (TMS)_**

    - The Time Management System (TMS) is a MERN stack application designed to streamline employee time tracking and project management. The system supports three primary roles: employee, HR, and admin.

    - Admin: Manages employee logs, project allocation and deallocation, and oversees employee performance and time management. Admins can also fill in logs on behalf of employees, send automated reminders for incomplete logs, and generate reports on project allocations and employee activity.

    - HR: Responsible for timesheet management, project allocations, and task assignments, with the ability to monitor and update project statuses.

    - Employees: Can log daily work activities, track project-related tasks, and submit timesheets.

    - The system ensures efficient timesheet management and automated reminders through email notifications for incomplete logs or pending tasks.

3.  **career gap between greeksoft and green apex company can we explain**

    - During my time between Greeksoft Technologies and Green Apex Solutions, I faced personal challenges that helped me improve my problem-solving and time management skills. I also completed a frontend development certification, further strengthening my technical expertise. This experience has prepared me to contribute effectively in my next role from day one.

4.  **why you will choose first embedded system then web development field?**

    - I initially chose embedded systems due to my interest in low-level hardware and software interaction, which gave me a strong foundation in problem-solving and optimizing resource-constrained environments. However, as I explored more aspects of software development, I became drawn to web development because of its fast-paced innovation, wider scope for creativity, and ability to impact users on a large scale. This shift allowed me to apply my technical skills in a more dynamic field while continuously learning and adapting to new technologies, particularly in frontend development and the MERN stack.
